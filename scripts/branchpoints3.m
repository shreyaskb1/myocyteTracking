% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This is a function that takes in a 3D skeletonized logical image of size
% MxNxP and prodcues a logical image containing location of branch points.
% I was motivated by the lack of a 3D lookup table (LUT) or bwlookup within
% MATLAB. This function is ideal for deducing branchpoints in vasculature
% or pipes.
% -------------------------------------------------------------------------
% USAGE:
%   BP = branchpoints3(skel)
%   This command will produce a logical image same size as skel that
%   obtains pranchpoint using a 3x3x3 local region.

% Nesting 'for' loops here allow a "scanning" like mechanism where the
% region of size sz-by-sz scans from one edge of x-axis to the other, then
% shifts up by one voxel on the y-axis and scans along the x-axis again.
% AFter scanning the entire xy-plane, it moves one voxel up the z-plane and
% rescans the xy-plane. It does this until the entire image is scanned.

            % Suppose in a 3x3x3 region containing 27 voxels, a continous 
            % line without branches in any plane would contain only 3 white
            % voxels. The presence of any additional voxels would imply the
            % presence of a branch. If this condition is met there is a
            % branch point in the region, otherwise there isn't.
